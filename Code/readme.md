## Code
1. The file contains Training.ipynb file where we performed bit of EDA and training of MobileNetV2 and SqueezeNet.

2. We have saved the trained model weights in model_squeezeNet.h5 and model_mobilenet.h5 files.

3. Face_Recognition.ipynb file contains code for implementation of loading the saved weights in the model and implementing Real time face recognition along with face 
detection for both cases.

4. Haar Cascade algorithm is present in haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

5. Sample Images for testing are stored in images folder.
